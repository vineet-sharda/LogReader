# Log Reader
"A few-weekend project"

Log files usually have thousands of logs, which are mostly similar. Sifting through them is time consuming. This reader can
 - read multiple log files
 - aggregate similar errors
 - export results to csv file
 - read particular errors, if needed.


Tested with 115 MB file with 790,000 rows.
Application remained responsive and without any spike in RAM usage.
