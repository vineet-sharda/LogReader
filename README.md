# Log Reader
"A few-weekend project"

Log files usually have logs which are mostly similar. This reader can
 - read multiple log files
 - aggregate similar errors
 - export results to csv file
 - read particular errors, if needed.


Tested with 112MB file with 780,000 rows.
Application remained responsive and without any spike in RAM usage.
